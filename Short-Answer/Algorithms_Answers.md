## Exercise I

a) As we have a while loop we will begin by looking inside the loop for the complexity of the interior operation, which is a constant operation with O(1) complexity.  However, when considering the math that is going on, we are evaluating essentially the case of adding the square of an inputted number to zero until that increasing number is greater than the cube of the inputted number.  By my estimations, this should take approximately two runs of the while loop to complete the case, with any value of n > 1.  The runtime complexity of the code snippet is O(1), as the runtime does not substantively change with an increase in n.


b)


c)
